====================================================================
=============Changelog==============================================

v1.4.3.7
BugFix:      Fix logic for checking valid inputtype when using CLI.
BugFix:      Fixed README and output of -help switch so the updated
             switches are shown properly.

v1.4.3.6
Added:       Added support to specify delay/cut values in audio frames.
Added:       Added "-help" switch to display the options available from CLI.
BugFix:      Fixed so that delay field in GUI worked properly.
BugFix:      Fixed CLI parser for to detect new switches.

v1.4.3.5
Added:       Logging of progress and error messages when using the CLI have been added back.
Changed:     "-console" switch has been removed.  Switches to specify cut points have been renamed to
             "-startcut" and "-endcut" respectively.  Switches to specify delay values have been renmaed
             to "-startdelay" and "-enddelay" respectively.  "-i" switch introduced to allow the specifying
             of the input file path anywhere in the CLI arguments.  "-version" switches introduced to get
             the current version of the software.

v1.4.3.4
BugFix:      Fix rounding when converting between input types to a round half up scheme.  Also changed
             the calculations for start and end frame to use the same.
BugFix:      Fixed check for enabling the CRC group edit so it enables properly.
BugFix:      Fix bug that where a pathological file caused the processing to never finish and UI hang.
BugFix:      Calculated end frame is capped to the total frames in cases where end split value specified
             exceeds length of file.
Changed:     Renamed "original length" field to "preserve length".
Changed:     End cut value of 0 is treated as end of file when calculating end frame.
Changed:     End cut and start cut values no longer cause the other field to be overwritten.  All checks to make
             sure that end cut is not smaller than start cut, except for the case of 0, happens when process
             button is clicked.

v1.4.3.2
BugFix:      Fix autodelay detection so that it converts ms value in fileName to the selected input type.
BugFix:      Fixed bugs in converting values between different input types.

BugFix:      Fixed bug where output file path wasn't updated when using 'Save As' dialog.

Improvement: In case of unsynchronized frame, rewind one frame more to look for the synch word inside the previous
             frame. (suggested by tebasuna51)
Changed:     AC3 silence frames are now calculated from only two patterns (2/0 and 5.1)

v1.2.0.4

Command Line Instructions
Output and log files will be in the same path than the input file.

-help:                 List options.
-version:              Get current version.
-info:                 Outputs info about input file in log file
-inputtype <string>:   Input type of delay/cut values. (default millseconds
                       when not specified) [milliseconds, seconds, videoframes]
-fps <float|rational>: Specify frame rate.
                       Needed when inputtype is set to frames.
-fixcrc <string>:      Specify action to take in the case of crc errors
                       [ignore, skip, fix, silence]
-startdelay <integer>: Specify the needed frames added at the beginning of the file
-enddelay <integer>:   Specify the needed frames added at the end of the file
-same:                 file length will be the same after adding delay
-auto:                 detect start delay in filename (assuming DVD2AVI style)
-startcut <integer>:   Specify cut start point
-endcut <integer>:     Specify cut end point
-o <string>:           specify output file
-i <string>:           specify inputfile

Return values
0: Success
1: Something went wrong.

Examples:
Get info: Log file will be myfile_log.txt
    delaycut -info -i myfile.ac3

Adds 100 msec of silence at the begining. File lenght will be the same
    delaycut -startdelay 100 -same -i myfile.ac3

Adds 100 msec of silence at the begining. File lenght will be 100 msecs more
    delaycut -startdelay 100 -i myfile.ac3

Cuts start at 10.32 sec and ends at 15.20 sec.
    delaycut -inputtype seconds -startcut 10.32 -endcut 15.20 -i myfile.ac3

Cuts start at 10320 msec and ends at 15200 msec. Delay correction of 100 msec.
    delaycut -startdelay 100 -startcut 10320 -endcut 15200 -i myfile.ac3
